# Rails Simple Config

A simple YAML based configuration for Ruby on Rails 3+, which supports shared settings, ERB and more.

Inspired in part by the database configuration in Rails, [app_config](https://github.com/die-antwort/app_config) and [rails_config](https://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config).

## Installation

Add RailsSimpleConfig to your Gemfile:

    gem 'rails_simple_config'

Run the generator to create the default configuration file:

    rails generate rails_simple_config:install

## Usage

### Define configuration settings

Define your settings in the generated `config.yml` file, found in your Rails root directory. 

The file contains sections for the development, test and production Rails environments, and a shared section.
It can also contain ERB code so that more advanced configuration scenarios can be supported.

    # example configuration
    
    shared: &shared
      title: My Website Title
      description: Meta description of the site
      keywords: Meta keywords for search engines
      
      no_reply_email: noreply@example.com
      
    development:
      # inherit shared settings
      <<: *shared
      
      # define additional settings and overrides
      
      # e.g. mail settings for mailcatcher
      smtp_server: localhost
      smtp_port: 1025
      mail_prefix: DEV -
    
    production:
      # inherit shared settings
      <<: *shared
      
      # define additional settings and overrides
      
      # e.g. mail settings for send grid
      smtp_server: www.sendgrid.com
      smtp_port: 25

### Access configuration settings

To access configuration settings in your Rails application, use the `SimpleConfig` global module.

For example, in your application layout:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title><%= SimpleConfig.title %></title>
        <meta name="description" content="<%= SimpleConfig.description %>" />
        <meta name="keywords" content="<%= SimpleConfig.keywords %>" />

        ...

      </head>
      <body>

        ...

      </body>
    </html>          

In addition, unlike other Rails configuration solutions, `SimpleConfig` is available to the development, test and production configurations, initializers and routes during startup.
It can be used as a replacement for environment variables; thus making your setup much cleaner.

For example, the `SimpleConfig.no_reply_email` will be accessible to the [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) initializer when configuring `mailer_sender`:

    # extract of the devise.rb initializer
    Devise.setup do |config|

      # ==> Mailer Configuration
      # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown in DeviseMailer.
      config.mailer_sender = SimpleConfig.no_reply_email

      ...

    end

### Notes

`SimpleConfig` inherits from [ActiveSupport::OrderedOptions](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/OrderedOptions.html), so accessing undefined settings will always return `nil`.
